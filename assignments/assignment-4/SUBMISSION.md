# Portfolio Styling Assignment Analysis

## Analysis
I had a few different approaches, I feel like my problem was impleneting it within my own style sheet. I'm also not that creative with how I'd like to do it. Most of the time my appraoches were not within what I could do as well. I did not finish due to other classes, but I learned a good ammount. I probably will work on it more on my own. I just didn't have enough time due to midterms rolling in.

## Lessons Learned
I learned how to use a few things like coloring flexing, grid templates as well as calculations with set variables. I also learned a few spacing stuff such as padding. Also learned how to create hover effects. Learned how to change fonts as well as space text as well

## Preferred Version
I prefer ai version 1, but I understand why it is preffered to learn from a person. there is only soo much specificality an ai can do when creating a website, and it's of best use to use what youy know and to add from ai when you don't know.
