## Analysis
I honestly saw the calculator posted and was just adding onto that, I just wrote the code and copy and pasted so I could remember most of the content. From my analysis on the code that was given I saw the scriptings of adding values and calculating scripts on calculator.js which helped a lot. I also saw the grid format he used and structure that was used using a submit form. The submit form was linked with the calculator.js which allowed for display and calculations. The thing that I really needed to improve was just my directory towards my calculator in my portfolio

## Lessons Learned
Use of node.js, and scripting. I also learned more in depth about grid templates.

## Preferred Version
My preffered would be the ai2 mostly because the animations behind it feels like an upgraded version of the regular calculator
