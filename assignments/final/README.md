PROJECT PROPOSAL
======================================
We intend to create a pinterest clone  using HTML, CSS, and javascript.

PLAN FOR MAIN FEATURES
======================================
Elements from each feature may not include everything shown on the real website either because we chose not to implement it or we missed it.

**Profile - Includes profile image, edit profile, created pins, saved pins. Saved pins are organized under boards and All Pins.

**Log-in Page - Show login or sign up button with a grid of stock images as the background. 

**Home Page - The homepage will display all pins made by the user in a grid layout. Also show 
posts made by other users.

**Pin Page (When you click an image) - A hyper-linked title that redirects to the link provided during creation, the pin description, and pin owner. These are all under the pin displayed. Display buttons that save to a board and save to profile. Button/Arrow icon to go back to home.

**Create Page - Contains a form to create a pin. Main things to implement include file upload, title, description, and link. Some features are not required to be able to submit a form.
